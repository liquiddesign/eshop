## [2.1.4] - 2023-08-29

### Added

- New ProductsProvider for high-performance caching and loading of products with semi-dynamic filtering.

    - **You have to run migration _20230812-v2_cache.sql_**
  - ProductsProvider uses two sets of own cache + every request is indexed in Nette cache.
  - During cache warmup second cache is used and after fully warmed up first cache is flipped and vice versa.
  - Supports full counting of attributes, dynamic filtering of OR attributes and price with minimal impact on performance.
  - **ProductsProvider has limited options of filtering and ordering, so check if your project is suitable for this cache!**
    - If the table containing cache states is empty, products will be loaded using the legacy method.
- ShopperUser now has ability to choose selected Customer via session
    - This adds option to log in as Customer, but act like child Customer (using his PriceLists, VisibilityLists and make order as him)
    - CatalogPermission is still used from original Customer

## [2.0.0-beta.1] - 2023-07-10

### Added

- **BREAKING:** Many entities now have foreign key to `Base/DB/Shop` entity
    - To run this version of Eshop you need to sync this entity to database
    - Some entities are saved to Shop, which is currently selected. For others, you can select Shp by yourself.
- **BREAKING:** New *ShopperUser* and *CheckoutManager*
    - *ShopperUser* is now extending *Nette\Security\User* and act like it
    - *CheckoutManager* is now not injected to *Container* and is available only by *ShopperUser*
    - *ShopperUser* should not use *CheckoutManager* directly
    - *CheckoutManager* uses *ShopperUser*
- **BREAKNG:** New Visibility system for Products
    - Properties hidden, hiddenInMenu, unavailable, recommended and priority are no longer stored in Product but in VisibilityListItem
    - These properties are now stored in *VisibilityListItem* which always have *VisibilityList*
    - Selection is same as Pricelists and Prices selection:
        - *VisibilityLists* are assigned to groups and customers
        - *VisibilityList* has priority, same as Pricelist
        - *VisibilityListItem* is selected based on assigned *VisibilityList*s to customer or group, and is found first product row based on priority of *VisibilityList*
        - You can use *ProductRepository::joinVisibilityListItemToProductCollection* to join them
            - *ProductRepository::getProducts* does this automatically and properties are available in Product getters, or directly in SQL as alias *visibilityListItem*
- **BREAKING:** Product content (content, perex) is not stored in Product but in ProductContent, based on Shop.

- You can pass parameter *lastOrder* of `CheckoutManager::createOrder`. Default is true. It can allow you to create a set of orders
  (just calling multiple createOrder in loop).
  With last order please pass parameter with *true* value. Following changes they are based on the need to create a set of orders.
- You can specify cart of `CheckoutManager::createOrder` in parameter with name *cart*.
- In following previous change you can call `getTopLevelItems` and `getItems` of `CheckoutManager` with *cart* parameter.
- You can now specify purchase discount apply directly to purchase and one time discount whole order without discount every cart item
- You can now choose cart in almost every method in checkoutManager and use multiple carts

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** PHP version 8.2 or higher is required
- **BREAKING:** Dropped support for Latte <3.0
- **BREAKING:** Comgate service is now provided only by Integrations service. Comgate package extension is still injected to *Container* with configuration.
- **BREAKING:** Many callbacks are now always arrays, so you need to call them with *Arrays::invoke*
- **BREAKING:** `CheckoutManager::addItemToCart` - parameter $checkInvalidAmount now accepts only enum `\Eshop\Common\CheckInvalidAmount`
- **BREAKING:** Old XML exports are no longer available, V2 exports are now default.
- **BREAKING:** Property primaryCategory on Product is now removed, primary category of Product is determined with entity ProductPrimaryCategory, which is unique for Product by CategoryType
    - Product can have 0..1 primary categories in CategoryType
    - To access Product primary category, use getPrimaryCategory function
    - Function *ProductRepository::getProducts* selects primaryCategory property based on selected Shop and setting of CategoryType for that Shop
- **BREAKING:** All parts of Product CSV import/export are moved to separate services `ProductExporter` and `ProductImporter`
    - Old CSV files are not compatible with new import
    - Imports/exports reflects changes in content, visibility and categories
    - Content, Perex and Categories are no longer in 'importColumns' array in configuration. They are now hard-coded in import/export services.
        - **BREAKING:** You NEED to remove them from you local configurations
- **BREAKING:** `SupplierCategory` now can have multiple paired Categories
- **BREAKING:** `SupplierProductRepository::syncProducts` overhauled to reflect all changes
    - **BREAKING:** Content (name, content, perex) import option "with the longest content" is removed
    - **BREAKING:** Content is regardless of import option imported only if content of product is empty
- **BREAKING:** `Product::toArray` now accepts `$shop` and `$selectContent` parameters. `$selectContent` defaults to true, so it selects content, even if it is not loaded. That can lead to performance
  issue, so always check how you use this.
- **BREAKING:** `ProductRepository::getProduct` parameter *productUuid* renamed to *$condition*. Now it is union type accepts array for *whereMatch* or exact *uuid*.
- **BREAKING:** changed behavior of `CheckoutManager::createCart`
    - If *active* parameter is false. No longer triggers event *onCartCreate*.
    - If *active* parameter is false. Property *activeCart* in shopper customer s not updated.

- Category code must be unique within the CategoryType

### Removed
