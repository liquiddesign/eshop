## [2.0.0-beta.1]

### Added

- **BREAKING:** Many entities now have foreign key to `Base/DB/Shop` entity
    - To run this version of Eshop you need to sync this entity to database
    - Selects in forms to entities with Shop, are always shown all with description of Shop state
- **BREAKING:** New *ShopperUser* and *CheckoutManager*
    - *ShopperUser* is now extending *Nette\Security\User* and act like it
    - *CheckoutManager* is now not injected to *Container* and is available only by *ShopperUser*
    - *ShopperUser* should not use *CheckoutManager* directly
    - *CheckoutManager* uses *ShopperUser*
- **BREAKNG:** New Visibility system for Products
    - Properties hidden, hiddenInMenu, unavailable, recommended and priority are no longer stored in Product but in VisibilityListItem
    - These properties are now stored in *VisibilityListItem* which always have *VisibilityList*
    - Selection is same as Pricelists and Prices selection:
        - *VisibilityLists* are assigned to groups and customers
        - *VisibilityList* has priority, same as Pricelist
        - *VisibilityListItem* is selected based on assigned *VisibilityList*s to customer or group, and is found first product row based on priority of *VisibilityList*
        - You can use *ProductRepository::joinVisibilityListItemToProductCollection* to join them
            - *ProductRepository::getProducts* does this automatically and properties are available in Product getters, or directly in SQL as alias *visibilityListItem*
- **BREAKING:** Product content is not stored in Product but in ProductContent, based on Shop.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** PHP version 8.2 or higher is required
- **BREAKING:** Comgate service is now provided only by Integrations service. Comgate package extension is still injected to *Container* with configuration.
- **BREAKING:** Many callbacks are now always arrays, so you need to call them with *Arrays::invoke*
- **BREAKING:** `CheckoutManager::addItemToCart` - parameter $checkInvalidAmount now accepts only enum `\Eshop\Common\CheckInvalidAmount`
- **BREAKING:** Dropped support for Latte <3.0
- **BREAKING:** Old XML exports are no longer available, V2 exports are now default.
- **BREAKING:** Property primaryCategory on Product is now removed, primary category of Product is determined with entity ProductPrimaryCategory, which is unique for Product by CategoryType
    - Product can have 0..1 primary categories in CategoryType
    - To access Product primary category, use getPrimaryCategory function
    - Function *ProductRepository::getProducts* selects primaryCategory property based on selected Shop and setting of CategoryType for that Shop
- **BREAKING:** All parts of Product CSV import/export are moved to separate services `ProductExporter` and `ProductImporter`
- XML exports accepts Shop parameter and used entities are affected by it.
- PriceList selects in XML exports now shows all PriceLists, even from different Shops. Truly active PriceLists are filtered afterward in exports.
- Category code must be unique within the CategoryType

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** Properties hidden, hiddenInMenu, unavailable, recommended and priority are no longer stored in Product but in VisibilityListItem

## [1.3.0 - 1.3.4] - 2023-03-26

### Added

- **BREAKING:** New Shopper option `autoFixCart`, defaults to **true**
    - If enabled, CartChecker is not shown and all changes to cart are immediately applied
    - If you are using CheckoutPresenter from package you are good to go, just hide CartChecker in template
        - If not you need to add `$this->shopperUser->getCheckoutManager()->autoFixCart();` at top of `startUp` function
- `CheckoutManager::addItemToCart` - parameter $checkInvalidAmount now accepts `bool|null|\Eshop\Common\CheckInvalidAmount`, more info in function doc
- ProfileForm - duplicate email validation added

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** DiscountCoupon code now must be unique. Before it had to be unique only to Discount, but that causes unpredictable behavior in case of same codes.
- DiscountCoupons validation of original cart price
- CouponForm - If coupon is applied, you can not change it. You must remove it from cart at first.
- Precision for prices computation in Admin is now 4 decimal places

### Removed

- ProfileForm - removed sending of email in case of email change - now it is responsibility of project

### Deprecated

- Pricelists in Shopper are no longer cached during request. DiscountCoupon is applied and removed during request and that can cause change of available pricelists

### Fixed
